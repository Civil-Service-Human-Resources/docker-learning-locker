# docker-learning-locker

This is a set of basic docker wrappers around the Learning Locker services allowing us to run each easily
and independently.

To bring everything up run `docker-compose up`

This gives you a clean installation of Learning Locker. You'll need to manually for now add a user and create your
logs

`node cli/dist/server createSiteAdmin `
